title: Does Your Writing Want To Be Read?
datafile: writing
---
There are hundreds, thousands, even **millions** of topics to read about. Why would anyone bother reading about _this_?

Even within each topic, someone else has or is going to write about it. Why should someone read _your_ writing, and not theirs?

-----

Any topic can be exciting. Any topic can be interesting. To the right audience, with the right words, explaining the right parts of that topic. As a technical writer, your job is to figure out how to tap into that.

If nobody wants to read your writing, you've failed. The reader's going to skip through your text when they really shouldn't. They're going to be too unfocused to really end up understanding it, only (maybe, possibly) picking up enough to pass a test about it and that's it.


## How to Excite

### Tell stories, but don't ramble

This doesn't mean 'include random factoids about some stranger' or 'describe some trip that you went on 15 years ago for no reason'… though you can do that if you want. Your writing should follow a progression. **A** happened, **B** followed – and finally **C**.

If you want to describe how a motherboard works, including some history about _why_ and _how_ the motherboard came about can make whoever's reading _want_ to find out about it. If you do it wrong, the story about how we got from early computers to the machines of today might come off as useless fluff though.

Why do people like stories? Because they're (usually) a fun way to convey what's happened and give information. If you tell a story well, you teach whoever's listening something and they're interested every step of the way. If you don't tell it well, they want to wander off halfway through.

> The Motherboard (then called the Planar) was developed by IBM for the IBM Personal Computer in 1981. They made it to replace the earlier 'backplane' system that was in use, and it reduced the engineering and economic costs of both building and buying computers.

> 'IBM-Compatible' computers are now called 'PCs', and the motherboard inside acts as the bus that enables graphics processing, audio processing, and networking abilities for the higher-level operating system.

> In the old 'backplane' system, every part of the computer was separate and was just combined with cables and connectors. This made things hard, because the different parts of the computer couldn't work together as well.

This gives information, yes. It explains when the motherboard was developed, by who, and why. It then jumps into the future and explains all the amazing things the motherboard does these days (in a bit of a clunky, hard-to-read way).

But then it jumps back in time for… no real reason? Why explain the backplane now when we've already moved on? The story's told out of order and it's giving us too much information in some parts (the IBM Personal Computer, wow how interesting).

> For almost as long as there's been home computers, the motherboard has played an integral part in the whole 'making computers work' thing.

> In the olden days of computing, before fancy words like 'graphics' and 'online' were used, every component in a computer was a separate circuit board. It would take a lot of wires – and a lot of boards – to assemble even the simplest machine. Lots of boards meant computers were hard to design, manufacturing them was difficult, and all that came with extra cost.
>
> Then IBM came along. Instead of a lot of separate boards, most functions were put onto just one: the *Planar*. Eventually the name 'motherboard' stuck, and what we're left with today is that one amazing board on your computer that's responsible for controlling everything else in there.

There's a charm to this explanation. A voice that seems **distinct** and resonates through the whole piece.

It gives some overview. Then it explains how things were before motherboards, and the issues. Then it explains that they were made, and what motherboards do today. Past, then future. No jumping around timelines – this is fairly simple and easy to follow.

In the above explanation, the name 'IBM Personal Computer' was mentioned, and I said that was too much weird historical info. But in this example, I mention that motherboards used to be called the 'Planar'. I think the mention works here because it's a curious, fun little oddity ('planar', seriously?) – and 'IBM made a computer called the IBM Personal Computer' isn't anywhere near as unexpected or interesting.

### Be Confident

You're the writer here. You're the one writing this content and deciding what language it should include.

Corporate, committee-driven text is dull. Amazingly dull. So much so that I'd rather grab an electric fence than read a full document of it. If you care so much about sticking to a professional tone that your writing loses every ounce of flair and excitement, readers will pick up on that.

You don't need to put similies about volcanoes and stories about lions being zapped with lasers into every paragraph that you write. But don't be afraid to show that you're in control of your text. That you're able to include **a voice** and **a tone** into it.

This is your shot to explain this concept or topic to someone who probably doesn't want to listen. Don't make them regret sitting through your writing – make them **understand the topic** and make them enjoy **reading** your text as much as you enjoyed **writing** it.
