Networking – how devices communicate – is not well understood. Simple user questions like <emph>"Why is my connection slow?"</emph> can be difficult to answer, especially when most networking courses dive so deeply into the technical content.

This course explains networking in a simple-to-follow way, across three sections:

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Basics</h2>
    <p>
      How networks work, plus troubleshooting

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Advanced</h2>
    <p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Extra Credit</h2>
    <p>
      Complicated topics, addressing and security
    </p>
  </a>
</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Overview</h2>

<p>Each section covers different topics:</p>

<div class="base-formatting">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basics:</strong> Internet traffic, DNS and domain names, and speed and connection issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> More IP topics, subnetting, and routing/switching to give more context.</li>
    <li><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> NAT and securing connections.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  Reading the pages in order means that topics will be introduced and explained before they're used. But if skipping and skimming pages leaves you more interested, feel free to do so.
