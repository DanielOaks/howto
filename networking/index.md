What is networking? Networking is essentially a way to transfer data between different computers and devices.

This guide goes through I.T. networking from start to finish. No matter what you're doing with computers, having a decent knowledge of networks will be useful. This page should help you figure out exactly what you _need_ to know, what'll help you day-to-day, and what you don't need to dig too deep into.


## Need-to-know

These are some core, foundational parts of networking. Having a decent working knowledge of these is useful and helps a lot with day-to-day problem solving.

1. [Packet Switching](/networking/packet-switching).
2. [IP (Internet Protocol)](/networking/ip).
3. [UDP and TCP](/networking/udptcp).
4. [DNS](/networking/dns).
5. [Speed and Connection Issues](/networking/connection-issues).
6. [MTR Tests](/networking/mtr).


## Good-to-know

These areas are also useful to know. They explain similar areas to the articles above but in deeper detail.

1. [Binary and Number Systems](/networking/binary).
2. [IPs and Subnets](/networking/ipsandsubnets).
3. [Switching](/networking/switching).
4. [Routing](/networking/routing).


## Extra Credit

These are some in-depth topics that you can look at once you've got a decent view of the above areas. These can be useful when troubleshooting more in-depth issues and for just knowing how the tech works more completely.

1. [NAT](/networking/nat).
2. [Secure Connections](/networking/secure-connections).


## Overview

I wrote these sections in the order they're listed here, but if you feel like it you can go through them in any order. Feel free to skip back and forth and skim parts that aren't as useful to you.

I hope this guide is useful to you! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DanielOaks/howto) is the place to reach out at!
