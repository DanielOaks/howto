<div class="h-3"></div>

What we know right now is that packets get sent between devices. These packets have IP addresses and can be sent with UDP or TCP. This is a good basic understanding of how networks work.

But:

- How do packets get sent between my home network and the internet?
- Once does my ISP send another ISP packets?
- What are Switches, Routers, DHCP, BGP, OSPF...?

There's a world of switching and routing equipment inside every organisation and across the whole internet. Here's where you learn more about how traffic moves across networks.

-----

In this section we'll peel back the curtain and show you how networks actually operate.

We'll cover:

- Binary and other numbering systems (very important for future sections).
- IP addresses â€“ how they're assigned, and how they are separated into different networks.
- Switches, which move traffic inside a single network.
- Routers, which move traffic between different networks.

By the end of this section you should have a more complete understanding of how traffic moves across local networks and the internet.
