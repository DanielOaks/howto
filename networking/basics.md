Networking is a **big topic.** Understanding how almost every device on earth can connect to each other and transfer photos, videos, and more is difficult.

Fortunately, this course is designed to be easy-to-follow and give you the info you need to get started.

-----

This section will:

- Explain why the internet was designed the way it is.
- Break down IP, UDP, and TCP â€“ these are core networking concepts.
- Explain how domain names like `google.com` are translated into IP addresses.
- Explain different types of speed and connection issues, and how to solve each.
- Explain the `MTR` tool, which is a very important tool for troubleshooting.

By the end of this section you should have a good idea of how the internet works and how to troubleshoot it if something is going wrong.
